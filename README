= TimeTravel

This lets you set the current time in your tests or specs, so you can do
things like:

  at_time("1 April 2020 2:32 UTC") do
    # some fancy code
  end
  
Inside the block, Time.now will return the time you provide. The time will
be restored to normal system time when the block exits, even if it throws
an exception.

The at_time function can take a Time object, or a string to parse into a time.

TimeTravel is only loaded in the Rails test environment. If you need it in
your development environment, just require 'time_travel'.
