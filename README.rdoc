= TimeTravel

Time Travel is a Rails plugin that makes it easy to write tests or specs for time-dependent code. It provides the at_time function:

  at_time("9 March 2018 2:32 UTC") do
    ...
  end

Inside the block, Time.now will return the given time. The time will
be restored to normal system time when the block exits.

The at_time function can take a Time object, or a String to parse into a time.

== Installation
